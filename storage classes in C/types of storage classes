There are 4 storage classes in C
1. automatic
2. register
3. static
4. external

Each of the storage classes define 4 properties for a variable üëç
1. Scope
2. Lifetime
3. location
4. Default value

1. Automatic variables
    by default the variables are auto
    - Scope: Local to the block in which it is defined
    - Lifetime: Till the control remains in the block
    - Location: Stack
    - Default value: Garbage value

Ex : auto int x;

2. Register variables
    - Scope: Local to the block in which it is defined
    - Lifetime: Until the block
    - Location: cpu register
    - Default value: Garbage value

Ex : register int x;

very important concept********************************
3. Static variables
    - Scope: Local to the block in which it is defined
    - Lifetime: Till the end of the program
    - Location: placed in seperate global/static part of ram
    - Default value: 0

Ex : static int x;


4. External variables
    - scope: global
    - Lifetime: till the end of the program
    - Location: placed in the global/static part of ram
    - Default value: 0

    - A variable/function can be extern.

Ex: extern int x;
